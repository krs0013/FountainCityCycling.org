<UL>
	<LI><P>Tap the giant <I><B>Start Recording! </B></I>button to instantly get started recording a bike trip. It will fire up the GPS receiver on your phone and begin tracking your ride. You can hit the <I><B>Pause</B></I> button to temporarily stop or start receiving GPS updates. Click <I><B>Finish</B></I> when you're done with your ride.</P> <LI><P>Thanks to Android's background-app capability, you don't need to do anything special to keep Cycle Atlanta running while you are recording a trip. You can set the phone to sleep, or use other apps while recording.</P></LI>
	<LI><P>In order to remind you that the app is running and to save your battery, your phone will ring like a bicycle bell after 15 minutes, and every 5 minutes thereafter. If Cycle Atlanta is running when your battery reaches less than 10% of its charge, the app will automatically stop collecting data and quit. </P></LI>

<p><A NAME="U2"></A><B>2. Selecting a Trip Purpose</B></P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">We're interested in the MAIN purpose for each trip you make. Think about
why you are out and about on your bike to begin with. If you're unsure how to categorize a trip, select &ldquo;Other&rdquo;. You can always attach a note to your data before submitting it.</P>

<p><A NAME="U3"></A><B>3. Personal Info</B></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: normal">Tap <I><B>Menu &gt; Edit User Info</B></I>. This is completely optional, and, if you choose to participate, only has to be done once. It involves a few basic questions useful to our study. Answering these questions is optional and your responses are completely confidential.</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">If you wish to give us your email address (which will not be shared with
any third parties), we can keep you updated on the progress of the study. </P>

<h4><A NAME="FAQ"></A>Frequently Asked Questions</h4>
<P><A NAME="F1"></A><I>What is the Cycle Atlanta app?</I></P>
<P>In order to collect data on why and where cyclists ride, we developed the
Cycle Atlanta applications for iPhone and Android. Cycle Atlanta uses your smartphone's GPS to track your rides. Once your ride is over, data representing the purpose, route, date and time are confidentially sent to the planners and researchers at the City of Atlanta and Georgia Tech.</P>

<P><A NAME="F2"></A><I>Why are you doing this?</I></P>
<P>We have been awarded a grant from the Atlanta Regional Commission to enhance bicycle infrastructure in the City of Atlanta.</P>
<P>The goal of the project is to better understand where cyclists ride in Atlanta and the factors that influence route choices (terrain, presence of bike lanes, purpose of trip, etc.) and how transportation infrastructure and land development might affect cyclists choosing to ride on particular streets.</P>

<P><A NAME="F3"></A><I>How long should i keep using Cycle Atlanta?</I></P>
<P>We hope you'll use Cycle Atlanta right away and get us as much data as possible. Our initial data collection period will run through mid 2013, but we will continue to examine data well past that date, so there's no reason to stop using it. The more data we receive, the more we can do for Atlanta cyclists!</P>

<P><A NAME="F4"></A><I>Why are my trip purpose and personal info important?</I></P>
<P>This is a new, one-of-a-kind dataset that's never been collected before. Our research has shown that different types of people use different routes, and that biking for exercise is really different from biking for groceries or commuting. Those little extra bits of information go a long way toward helping us understand how people cycle in Atlanta. You don't <b>have</b> to enter any personal info, but we hope you will since it just takes a few seconds and will never be shared or linked to specific recorded rides.</P>

<P><A NAME="F5"></A><I>What about my email address? I don't want any spam.</I></P>
<P>We'll keep the email addresses for project updates, but will never give your email out to anyone. If you choose
not to give us your email address, that's fine.</P>

<P><A NAME="F6"></A><I>What about other privacy issues?</I></P>
<P>Data representing the purpose, route, date and time are sent confidentially to servers being run by Georgia Tech and the City of Atlanta. Users can cancel a trip at any time for any reason and no data will be sent. No other identifying information is collected except with your opt-in permission.</P>
